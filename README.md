## Deployment
### Version Control
I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a local repository and IDE & [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

1. Firstly, I needed to create a new repository on Github [rapid-silver](https://github.com/KristianColville1/rapid-silver).
2. I opened that repository on my local machine by copying the URL from that repository and cloning it from my IDE for use.
3. Visual Studio Code opened a new workspace for me.
4. I created files and folders to use.
5. To push my newly created files to GitHub I used the terminal by pressing Ctrl + shift + `.
6. A new terminal opened and then I used the below steps.

    - git add (name of the file) *This selects the file for the commit*
    - git commit -m "Commit message: (i.e. Initial commit)" *Allows the developer to assign a specific concise statement to the commit*
    - git push *The final command sends the code to GitHub*

### Heroku
As a deployment solution I chose [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com).

To deploy a project using Heroku follow these steps:

- Log into heroku
- Go to the heroku dashboard
- Create a new app by selecting 'New'
- Give your application a name and select a preferred location
- Click the 'Create app' button
- If you have config variables in your application
    - Click on settings
    - Click 'Reveal config vars'
    - Input your deployment variables

- If you need specific build packs
    - Click on settings
    - Click on build pack
    - Add your packs as needed (Please be aware that the order matters)
    - For Tetromino Falls, Python and then NodeJs was selected.

- Once these steps are completed
    - Go to the deploy section
    - Select your version control system
    - For Tetromino Falls, GitHub was selected

- Connect your version control system
- Add your repository
- Connect the app selecting 'connect'
- Either choose automatic deployment or manual deployment
- Once all these steps are completed and the build is successful
    - You can click the 'view' button
    - It will reveal your deployed app
    
### Cloning this Repository
If you would like to clone this repository please follow the bellow steps.

Instructions:

1. Log into GitHub
2. Navigate to the repository you want to clone
3. Click on the green button labelled 'Code'
4. Copy the URL under the HTTPS option
5. Open an IDE of your choosing that has Git installed
6. Open a new terminal window in your IDE
7. Type this exactly: git clone the-URL-you-copied-from-GitHub
8. Hit Enter

You should have a local copy of the repository to use on your machine.
